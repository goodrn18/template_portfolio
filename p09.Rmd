```{r load_packages}
library(tidyverse) 
library(infer)
library(openintro)

```{r load_data}
data(ncbirths)
nrow(ncbirths)
summary(ncbirths)
```

### Exercise 1

Each case is a pregnancy case - so mom and baby. There are 1000 cases.
Numerical: fage, mage, weeks, visits, gained, weight
Categorical: Mature, premie, marital, lowbirthweight, gender, habit, whitemom
Weight gained by the mother appears to have an outlier at 85 lbs. Birth weight has a low outlier at 1lb, and weeks at 20.

### Exercise 2

Average birth weight for babies of white moms: 7.25 lbs
```{r white_moms}
ncbirths_white <- ncbirths %>% 
  filter(whitemom == "white")

mean(ncbirths_white$weight, na.rm = TRUE)
```
